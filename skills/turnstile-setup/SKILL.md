description: Install the turnstile plugin and pipeline agents into the user's ~/.config/opencode and verify sync. Use when the user asks to set up turnstile, run the pipeline gates, add pipeline gates to a session, or after changing marker syntax in this repo. The plugin injects the orchestrator policy at runtime (via the execute.after hook); it does not write a contract block into AGENTS.md.

# Turnstile setup

Install the turnstile plugin and the pipeline agent definitions into the
user's `~/.config/opencode` and verify the install. The orchestrator policy
is injected at runtime by the plugin (`src/policy.ts`) — nothing is written
to any instructions file, ever.

Two contexts this skill can run in; detect which one you are in first:

- **Inside the turnstile git repo** (a `.git` directory plus a `package.json`
  with an `init` script): use the repo commands `npm run init` /
  `npm run install:check`. Symlink mode is the default there — the checkout
  stays the source of truth.
- **Anywhere else** (npm-package or npx context): use the CLI,
  `npx opencode-turnstile init` / `npx opencode-turnstile check`. Do NOT run
  `npm run init` — that script only exists in the repo. The install mode is
  resolved from an explicit flag, then the manifest's `mode` field, then
  auto-detect: a `.git` checkout installs by linking, a package install
  copies.

## Steps

1. Install:

   - In the repo: `npm run init`
   - Elsewhere: `npx opencode-turnstile init`

   Don't override the mode unless a step fails. Use `--copy` only when the
   user refuses symlinks or the install target is a dotfiles repo that
   rejects them (repo: `npm run init -- --copy`; CLI:
   `npx opencode-turnstile init --copy`). Copy mode records everything in a
   ledger (`~/.config/opencode/.turnstile-install.json`).

   Targets come from `install.json`; unowned files in the target directories
   are never touched. Conflicts (a real file differing from the repo, or a
   user-edited copy) fail with a per-path summary. Show the user the output
   and stop — don't force anything with `--force` without asking.

2. Verify — must exit 0:

   - In the repo: `npm run install:check` (add `-- --copy` for copy mode)
   - Elsewhere: `npx opencode-turnstile check`

   Drift or a conflict is reported per path; `check --repair` prints a
   write-free "would repair" dry run, and `install --repair` auto-fixes
   missing/stale paths (a real conflict still needs `--force`, with the
   user's say-so). Both `init` and `check` also load-probe the installed
   plugin entry point and report `loadable`/`unloadable` — an unloadable
   import graph fails the run. `npx opencode-turnstile uninstall` removes
   manifest-owned files when the user wants them gone.

3. AGENTS.md is out of scope: turnstile never writes to any instructions
   file — the orchestrator policy is injected at runtime from `src/policy.ts`,
   and nothing under `~/.config/opencode` besides the manifest targets
   should be touched. Do not paste anything into AGENTS.md.

4. Tell the user to **restart OpenCode** (or `opencode service restart`) so
   the plugin loads. Give them the status command for later:

   - In the repo: `node bin/cli.mjs status [--json]` (the local checkout)
   - Elsewhere: `npx opencode-turnstile status [--json]`

## Repo-only maintenance note

Inside the repo after changing marker syntax, run `node scripts/check-markers.mjs`
(it extracts the parser regexes from `turnstile.ts` and `src/markers.ts` and
asserts every README example, agent template, policy template, and the
evidence emitter's `MARKER_OK` copy parses; it also guards the canonical
marker shape and runs malformed/trailing-junk negative probes); that is a
development check, not part of a user install — skip it elsewhere.

## Report

Tell the user: which files were linked or copied (created or updated), which
mode was used (link vs copy), that the orchestrator policy is injected at
runtime (no instructions-file block), that OpenCode must be restarted to
load the plugin, and the status command for later. Do not quote the injected
policy back; summarize.
